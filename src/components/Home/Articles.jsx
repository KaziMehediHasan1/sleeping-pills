        <h1 className="text-xl font-semibold">What is Insomnia?</h1>
        <p>
          Insomnia can be defined as the inability to fall asleep at night. Most
          cases of insomnia can be transient and usually pass without the need
          for medical treatment but in some cases the problem can become
          chronic, which can cause a negative impact on life during waking
          hours. A person may be regarded as suffering from chronic insomnia if
          experiencing sleep problems 3 times per week or more and for 3 months
          or longer and to resolve this issue, many people rely on sleeping
          tablets to get to sleep at night.

        <h1 className="text-xl font-semibold">Types of Insomnia</h1>
        <p>
          There are a number of sleeping problems that may be defined as
          insomnia. These include problems falling asleep at night, waking up
          frequently throughout the night, or waking too early in the morning.
          These types of sleeping problems often leave sufferers feeling tired
          throughout the following day, resulting in under performance at work,
          lethargy and a general lack of drive and concentration.

        <h1 className="text-xl font-semibold">Causes of Insomnia</h1>
        <p>
          There are a number of factors that may cause insomnia. Often, medical
          conditions can trigger periods of sleeplessness. These may include
          back pain, arthritis, gastrointestinal problems and sleep apnoea. Some
          medications are also known to cause sleep problems including medicines
          for the treatment of high blood pressure, asthma, nasal allergies and
          depression. Psychological factors can also be a major cause of
          sleeping disorders. Conditions such as anxiety, stress and depression
          often make it hard to fall asleep at night and many people resort to
          using sleeping tablets to get a good night's sleep. Sometimes, a
          recent traumatic experience or worrying about financial matters or
          relationship problems can make it difficult to fall asleep at night.
          In fact, around half of all cases of insomnia arise as a result of
          psychological stress.

          using sleeping tablets and some basic changes to routine and lifestyle
          habits can often enable a good night's sleep. There are also certain

              bedtime.

              avoid problems falling asleep.

            <li>
              Alcohol. Drinking alcohol often has a sedating effect but is known

          For people who suffer with severe or chronic insomnia, sometimes
          lifestyle changes alone will not be sufficient to provide a good
          night's sleep. In such situations, sleeping pills can be a fast,
          effective way to fall asleep quickly and stay asleep for the duration
          of the night. Although sleeping pills can provide fast results, they
          should not be regarded as a long term solution. In most cases, they
          are effective in breaking the cycle of chronic insomnia and their use
          can be gradually reduced over a number of weeks until they are no
          longer required. On a one-off basis, they can also be particularly
          useful when travelling on long haul flights when normal sleeping
          patterns are disturbed. To summarize, although highly effective,
          sleeping pills should be used for the short term treatment of insomnia
          when all other attempts to deal with sleeplessness issues have proved
          ineffective.
